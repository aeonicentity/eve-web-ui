# eve-web-ui
A library of reusable web UI components for EVE Online.

# compatability
These components are partially written as a personal experiment with shadow dom, and also looking forward to the dawn of reusable web UI components in the next few years.

These components use shadow DOM

Which as of time of this document being written is only being used in chrome, Opera and Safari (you know, modern browsers. Sorry Firefox and IE, you're not browsers any more!).
